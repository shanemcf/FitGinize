# Fitginize - P1G10
Fitginize is a Front-end Project consisting of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's main purpose is to help people plan their workouts weekly and record them.
They can have an idea of the weather in the next 3 days based on where they live and they can also find workouts as well as save and track their progress over time.

## Motivation 
As too many terrible workout application that often require payments, are hard to navigate or interrupt your workout with ads, flood the market, we want to bring a solution by offering Fitginize. Fitginize is free and simply let's you organise your daily workouts. 

## What does Fitginize do ?
Fitginize enables you to choose from an extensive list of workouts and enter how many reps you would like to execute as well as how many sessions. This data gets saved so that the user could look at it again later and track his progresses.
Additionaly, Fitginize enables you to have an idea of the weather in the next 3 days so that you can decide if you want to work out outside or inside.

## Technology Used 
##### jQuery
##### Materialize (Material Design library)
##### Moment.js for the dates and sending the information to the weather API
##### Modals for user identification and location input
##### Local Storage to store user's information, location and exercise routine.

## Challenges encountered 
##### Main challenges encountered were during the merging of all the different branches.
##### Importing the background picture into the index.html file because it was initially on the local drive
##### Using the REST API end-points to it's full capability
##### Getting the name saved into the local storage because of an ID issue in the index. html file
##### Getting the modal to display properly after the merge

## Direction for future development
